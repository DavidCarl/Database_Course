# Task-2

### Made by David Carl

## Disclaimer

This is made on a unix based system and made for a unix based system, I cannot offer support for anything else. If you dont have a unix based system, I recommend you strongly to get one! Either on a virtual machine, a VPS or even dual boot / full linux install. I can recommend Ubuntu as a good start.

## Installation

### Local

I would do it this way to run it on you local computer.

```wget https://github.com/DavidCarl/Database_Course/raw/master/Task-2/Task-2.zip```

use your favorite linux zip tool! I use the following

```unzip Task-2.zip```

See usage for how to use it!

## Usage

First off you have to install dependencies. I included a file that dictates which dependencies you need.

You need to run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Then you need to run ```python main.py```

This should run the script and print out the results.
