FROM classicmodels.payments as p
inner join customers c on p.customerNumber = c.customerNumber
inner join employees e on c.salesRepEmployeeNumber = e.employeeNumber
inner join offices o on e.officeCode = o.officeCode
group by o.officeCode;
```

Windowing:

```
SELECT DISTINCT o.officeCode, SUM(p.amount) OVER (PARTITION BY o.officeCode ) as Total, MAX(p.amount) OVER (PARTITION BY o.officeCode) as MaxPayment
FROM payments p
INNER JOIN customers c on p.customerNumber = c.customerNumber
INNER JOIN employees e on c.salesRepEmployeeNumber = e.employeeNumber
